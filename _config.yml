about_content: |
  As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a writer. I never really had any other
  plans. As a kid I was writing imitations of the Goosebumps books I was reading and as soon as I'd finished 
  my creative writing degree at University I was lending my barely developed skills to anyone who would take
  me. It's a lifelong obsession with crafting a good sentence, on any subject, for anyone who needs it.
  Fortunately my skills have developed a lot since those early freelance days, and it's because every day I
  could since I wrapped my eight-year-old hand around a pencil, I haven't stopped writing.
