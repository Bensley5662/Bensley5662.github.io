about_content: |
  Tom (never Thomas) Bensley: writer of various things. Has worked as a content/copy writer, film critic, events reviewer and many (many, many) 
  other non-writing related professions. Prefers to work for pay due to increasingly controversial belief that good writing is worth money. Has
  lived in Melbourne (Australia) and Berlin (Germany). Prefers Berlin despite winter. Plays bass guitar but not because he also plays 'normal' 
  guitar already. Has no pets and doesn't understand why bios often include number of pets in possession.
